This subfolder contains my Julia code and additional resources related to this code.

In particular this folder includes a Jupyter notebook written in Julia. This code was written as a research project in my macroeconomics graduate course.

This code is about modelling an integrated assessment model that shows the effects of different carbon tax levels on CO2 concentration, temperature and other variables.
